Covid Bed Slot Booking System is in the form of a website with the frontend implemented using HTML, CSS, JS and MySQL. PYTHON- FLASK, HTML and CSS are used to build the user interface and database was built using MySQL.
Bed Management in this pandemic has become an issue that almost all of the families of covid patients face. But by using the latest technology this problem can be solved, the main reason for this problem is hospitals not having a proper portal for managing beds. Our solution to this problem can be used to save many lives of covid patients. Therefore, we have tried to address this problem with help of our project where the focus is to make sure that every covid patient gets a bed. We have achieved this by creating two apps one for users through which they can request a bed in a hospital and another one for hospitals where they can manage beds.
The objective of our app is to provide an efficient bed management system in this pandemic to save lives of covid patients.
