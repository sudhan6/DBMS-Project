# DBMS-Project
Covid Bed Slot Booking System is in the form of a website with the frontend implemented using HTML, CSS, JS and MySQL. PYTHON- FLASK, HTML and CSS are used to build the user interface and database was built using MySQL.
Bed Management in this pandemic has become an issue that almost all of the families of covid patients face. But by using the latest technology this problem can be solved, the main reason for this problem is hospitals not having a proper portal for managing beds. Our solution to this problem can be used to save many lives of covid patients. Therefore, we have tried to address this problem with help of our project where the focus is to make sure that every covid patient gets a bed. We have achieved this by creating two apps one for users through which they can request a bed in a hospital and another one for hospitals where they can manage beds.
The objective of our app is to provide an efficient bed management system in this pandemic to save lives of covid patients.

Methodology:
In this project implementation" of Python should be taken to mean a program or environment which provides support for the execution of programs written in the Python language, as represented by the Python reference implementation. There have been and are several distinct software packages providing of what we all recognize as Python, although some of those are more like distributions or variants of some existing implementation than a completely new implementation of the language. Back End (MySQL) Database: A Database Management System (DBMS) is computer software designed for the purpose of managing databases, a large set of structured data, and run operations on the data requested by numerous users. Typical examples of DBMSs include Oracle, DB2, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, Firebird, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, FileMaker and Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise. DBMSs are typically used by Database administrators in the creation of Database systems. Typical examples of DBMS use include accounting, human resources and customer support systems. Originally found only in large companies with the computer hardware needed to support large data sets, DBMSs have more recently emerged as a fairly standard part of any company back office.
